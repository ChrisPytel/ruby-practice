# Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters

# A comment, Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

puts "multiline comments are defined with =begin and =end"

=begin 

puts "These comments"
puts "definitly wont"
puts "display in the console"

=end
