# Exercise 11: Asking Questions


print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."

#gets.chomp awaits for a string to be typed and enter to be pressed to store the string in memory

# the print command prints the string without requiring a \n (newline) to be added
# puts requires a \n to register a newline
